I'm building a multi-language Windows desktop visualizer app. This phase focuses only on the Electron + Vite + TypeScript frontend. The visualizer uses either fake data (like sine waves or random values) or mic input to animate real-time visuals using Canvas or WebGL.

Help me:
- Create visualizer components that receive audio data and animate accordingly
- Structure my Electron + Vite project properly (renderer and main process)
- Setup transparent, always-on-top, click-through Electron window
- Build simple UI to choose visualizer style (bars, waveform, circle)
- Handle performance (smooth animation, FPS info)

DO NOT assume I’m using any prebuilt template. I want to understand what I’m doing. Don’t over-simplify or skip important architectural parts. Focus on clarity and developer control.
